Welcome to my blog. This is a space where I'll share thoughts on design, development, and the creative experiments I'm working on.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Design process** - How I approach problems and make decisions
- **Development** - Technical deep-dives and lessons learned
- **Lab experiments** - Behind the scenes of my interactive projects
- **Industry thoughts** - Observations on trends and tools

## Why Write?

Writing helps me think. It forces clarity on ideas that otherwise stay fuzzy. And if something I share helps someone else, even better.

> The best way to learn is to teach.

## Stay Tuned

I'm excited to build this space. If you want to chat about anything, feel free to [reach out](/contact).
